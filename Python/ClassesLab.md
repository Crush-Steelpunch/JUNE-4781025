# Classes Lab

Goal: “Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for depositing and withdrawing funds from each category, as well computing category balances and transferring balance amounts between categories”

```python

class Budget:
    pass

clothing = Budget()
entertainment = Budget()

clothing.withdraw(20)
entertainment.deposit(5)

```

### LetterCheck

- write a class called 'Lettercheck'
- create an attribute called vowels and fill it with vowels
- create a method that takes a single letter and checks if it is a vowel
- return true or false
- rewrite the class so you can create different objects for finding if letters are members of different letter groups

### Another simple coding example Classes

Dice Class
- Write a class called Dice
- When initialised the object will set how many faces the die has
- Create objects for 6, 20, 2 and 4 sided die.
- Roll a charactor sheet for a Swashbuckler Rogue called 'Earl Grey' DnD 5th ed.


### Polygon

Goal: “Create class and sub-class objects which represent different geometrical shapes, such as Rectangles and Squares”

objects should have methods to display area and perimeter
