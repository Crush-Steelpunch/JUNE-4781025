# Classes Lab

Goal: “Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for depositing and withdrawing funds from each category, as well computing category balances and transferring balance amounts between categories”

```python

class Budget:
    pass

clothing = Budget()
entertainment = Budget()

clothing.withdraw(20)
entertainment.deposit(5)
