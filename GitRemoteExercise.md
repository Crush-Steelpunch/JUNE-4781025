## Working with remote code repositories

- Create an account in Github (or use an existing one)
- Create a repository in Github. (make the name relevent to the course, add a README)
- Create a PAT for your account
  - <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>
- Clone your repository to your LoD machine in Git Bash
  - `git clone <https url>`
- Open the folder in VSCode
- Create a new file and add some contents
- Stage (add), and commit the changes to the local repo
- push the changes back to GitHub, use the Token to authenticate
